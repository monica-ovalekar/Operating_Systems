Remote Procedure Call - Distributed System

Modify the program described in Assignment 3 in such a way that the two programs can be run on different machines using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). 
Remote procedure calls allow programs to make procedure calls into remote programs running on a different machine across the network and are therefore fundamental in building a distributed system. 
The  receiver.c and the processor.c have the same functionality as described in Assignment 3 except that they should use remote procedure calls to communicate and achieve the same functionality.
