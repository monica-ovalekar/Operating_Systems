Shell Program - Programming assignment

Implement a simple command line shell program in C that interacts with the user in the following way. 
By default, the shell gives a prompt to the user. When the user types in a command (in response to its prompt) and hits Enter, the shell creates a child process that executes the command he entered and displays the results if any. 
It then prompts for more user input by displaying the prompt again. 

For example, when the user types command ls, the shell should display a listing of files in the current working directory. 
Your program should achieve this by simply passing this command to the underlying shell and receiving the results generated by it. 
Do not try to implement the functionality of the command within your own program.

The shell can be limited to handling basic commands that do not involve piping and redirection.
